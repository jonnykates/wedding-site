    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>West Dorset is a very popular tourist destination during August and we would therefore recommend booking accommodation as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>
    <p>The reception venue is in a small seaside village which is a 15 minute taxi back to Bridport; or 30 minutes to the larger towns of Dorchester or Weymouth - both of which have large chain hotels as well as B&amp;Bs.</p>

      <h3>Parking</h3>
      <p>Bridport has a number of pay-and-display car parks within walking distance of the ceremony including the East Street (DT6 3LL), South Street (DT6 3RT), Rope Walks (DT6 3RA), and West Street (DT6 3TP). The reception is then a 15 minute drive along the coast with adequate free parking.</p>

    <p>The most important thing to us is to have you there on our wedding day - especially as many of you may be travelling long distances. However, if you would like to give a small contribution towards our honeymoon that would be greatly received.</p>

    <h3>The Greatest Adventure, A Hobbit's Tale</h3>
    <p class="poem__para">The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.<br />
    Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.<br />
    The chances, the changes are all yours to make.<br />
    The mold of your life is in your hands to break.</p>
    <p class="poem__para">The greatest adventure is there if you're bold.<br />
    Let go of the moment that life makes you hold.<br />
    To measure the meaning can make you delay;<br />
    It's time you stop thinkin' and wasting the day.</p>
    <p class="poem__para">The man who's a dreamer and never takes leave<br />
    Who thinks of a world that is just make-believe<br />
    Will never know passion, will never know pain.<br />
    Who sits by the window will one day see rain.</p>
    <p class="poem__para">The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.<br />
